We are super awkward in front of the camera - will you help us?

Part of my job is understanding how to make you look your best and represent you in the most authentic way
possible. The reason I have such an extensive contact form is so that I get to know you before our session. It is 
so important to me that I understand what makes you unique and what you really want these photos to represent.
I have spent countless sessions and hours figuring out the best way to move my clients through the sessions in
the most natural way possible. I PROMISE you, you do not need to be a professional model, I know exactly what
 to do to make your photos turn out the best way possible. Let’s get to know each other so that when it comes 
time to shoot we are like old best friends.


How far in advance should we book with you?
I suggest anywhere between 6-months to a year out. I HIGHLY recommend booking 1-year out. No matter what,
it doesn’t hurt to shoot me an email. For any sort of session, such as engagements, proposals, anniversaries,
Portrait etc. Sometimes I have done them with less than a week’s notice. HOWEVER! I do not suggest this, as
I send all my clients an extensive preparation guide so that their wedding photos turn-out the best. I recommend
booking 30-60 days in advance if you want your portrait photos to be there best. Most importantly what if i 
are not available on your required date. I don’t want you to feel sad, it’s always better to start talking your earliest.
Start talking will not cost you anything! Let’s talk.
